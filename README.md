This is a minecraft mod which adds post-game challenges, by letting you refight all the game's bosses in a Boss Rush!

To unlock the boss rush, you'll need to find a ruined portal within the end, and use a nether star to open a gate to a new dimension.
If you have beaten all main foes available (modded included if mods such as Cataclysm is present), you can start a boss rush by using
the altar present there.

Keep in mind this mod doesn't add anything else!

Good luck!
